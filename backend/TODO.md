# TODO: User Authentication Flow Implementation

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Updated frontend/js/auth.js to add form event listeners for register and login
- [x] Modified auth.js to use API methods (registerWithAPI, loginWithAPI) instead of localStorage
- [x] Updated frontend/js/account.js to load user data from API using JWT token
- [x] Ensured proper token handling and redirects after auth

## Next Steps
- [ ] Start the backend server to test the authentication flow
- [ ] Test user registration flow: register.html → API → account.html
- [ ] Test user login flow: login.html → API → account.html
- [ ] Verify token persistence across page reloads
- [ ] Test account page access with valid token
- [ ] Test logout functionality
- [ ] Handle API errors gracefully (network issues, invalid credentials, etc.)

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Register new user with valid data
- [ ] Login with registered credentials
- [ ] Access account page after login
- [ ] Verify user data loads correctly in account page
- [ ] Test logout and redirect to index
- [ ] Test accessing account page without token (should redirect to login)
- [ ] Test invalid login attempts
- [ ] Test duplicate email registration

## Notes
- Backend API endpoints are already implemented in backend/api/routes/auth.js
- Frontend forms now properly submit to API endpoints
- Token is stored in localStorage and used for authenticated requests
- Account page loads user data from /api/auth/me endpoint
